/**
 Initializes a cancelable, one-shot timer in suspended state.
 
 @param delay  The delay in seconds after the timer will fire
 
 @param tolerance Setting a tolerance for a timer allows it to fire later than the scheduled fire date. Allowing the system flexibility in when a timer fires increases the ability of the system to optimize for increased power savings and responsiveness.
 
 @param queue  The queue on which to submit the block.
 
 @param block  The block to submit. This parameter cannot be NULL.
 
 @return A SLTimer object that has been initialized.
